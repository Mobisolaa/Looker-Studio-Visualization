- Only about 9% of the tickets raised were emergencies, otherwise tickets raised were mostly normal.
- As at date of data generation, 86% of the request had been closed out, although 90% of it were in breach of agreed SLA.
- This can be attributed to the fact that 78% of the tickets raised were assigned to Jared Smith alone, hence the delay in closing.
- More than 68% of tickets raised are incidents/ problems- A root cause analysis will be necessary to tackle this.
